First, let's state the problem.

We have a doll supply chain hierarchy:

We have two types of dolls
-------------------------------------
Russian doll -- Can have either a Russian doll or a solid doll inside it
Solid doll   -- It cannot have anything inside it.

We have three types of relationships
-------------------------------------
Supplier  -- manufactures the actual dolls
Us        -- the middle man
Customers -- could be a reseller or a consumer

Type  From        To          Which
-------------------------------------
A     Supplier    Us          Russian doll
B     Supplier    Us          Solid doll
C     Supplier    Customer    Russian doll
D     Supplier    Customer    Solid doll
E     Us          Customer    Russian doll
F     Us          Customer    Solid doll
G     Customer    Customer    Russian doll
H     Customer    Customer    Solid doll


Each doll has a type.  
Each doll has a containing doll, which also has a type.
At some point, the containing doll is null (we've hit the outermost item).
The supplier only gives out outermost dolls and solid dolls.

Our tree looks like:

        A            B         C      D
     |----|                 |----|
     E    F                 G    H
   |--|                   |--|
   G  H                   G  H
 |--|                    ...
 G  H
...

Write code that can do the following:
1) Given a type, list the possible parent types
2) Given a type, list the possible child types
